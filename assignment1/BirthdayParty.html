<h2> Lyrics: </h2>
<p> All my girls at the party, look at that body </p>
<p> Shakin' that thing like you never did see</p>
<p>Got a nice package alright</p>
<p>Guess I'm gonna have to ride it tonight</p>
<p>All my girls at the party, look at that body</p>
<p>Shakin' that thing like you never did see</p>
<p>Got a nice package alright</p>
<p>Edit; four, three, two, one</p>
<p>It's all for you</p>
<p>If you really want it</p>
<p>It's all for you</p>
<p>If you say you need it</p>
<p>It's all for you</p>
<p>If you gotta have it</p>
<p>It's all for you if you make a move</p>
<p>It's all for you</p>
<p>...</p>

    <h2> Who is Janet Jackson? </h2>
<p>Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and dancer. She is noted for her innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows. Her sound and choreography became a catalyst in the growth of MTV, enabling her to rise to prominence while breaking gender and racial barriers in the process. Lyrical content which focused on social issues set her reputation as a role model for youth. </p>

<p> The tenth and youngest child of the Jackson family, she began her career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times, Diff'rent Strokes, and Fame. After signing a recording contract with A&M Records in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third and fourth studio albums Control (1986) and Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap, and industrial beats, which led to crossover success in popular music.</p>

    <p> All for You is the seventh studio album by American singer Janet Jackson. It was released on April 24, 2001, by Virgin Records. The album's development and theme were rooted in Jackson's separation from husband Ren√© Elizondo Jr. as she was getting to know what dating is like for the first time. Unlike The Velvet Rope, which saw Jackson tackling darker issues such as domestic violence and depression, All for You showcased a mix of upbeat dance-pop and slow R&B sounds, incorporating rock, disco, and funk, as well as soft rock and East Asian music. Its lyrics focus on passion, romance, and intercourse, also discussing themes of betrayal and deceit. The explicit language and sexual content of several songs sparked controversy, causing the album to be banned in several countries. </p>
    <p>All for You received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended its upbeat nature and the sonic innovation of several songs. It was also considered one of her sexiest albums and among the best of her career. The album received three Grammy Award nominations, including Best Pop Vocal Album, winning Best Dance Recording for its title track. It became Jackson's fifth consecutive album to top the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and had the biggest opening week sales of her career. Upon its release, it also had the second highest first-week sales for a female artist in Nielsen Soundscan history. It reached the top five of most countries internationally and was the biggest selling international pop album of the year in Japan. Certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it has sold over three million copies in the US according to Nielsen Soundscan and an estimated five million copies internationally. All for You was the twelfth best-selling album of the year worldwide, and was one of the best-selling albums of the decade in the United States.
